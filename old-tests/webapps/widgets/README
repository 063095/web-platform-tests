The test suite for the Widget Access Request Policy specification (aka WARP) is divided into two parts: the main part is in CVS and the other part is in Hg/Mercurial:

1. CVS
  http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2006/waf/widgets-access/test-suite/

2. Hg/Mercurial
  http://w3c-test.org/webapps/widgets/warp/

The test suite must reside on two different domains to facilitate cross-domain testing. See the WARP spec for more information:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-access/

The resources in the Hg part are MANDATORY and MUST NOT BE MOVED.

(Note: the directory structure of this test suite is different than WebApps' other test suites. This may be fixed at some point in time ...)

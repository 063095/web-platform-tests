        This document is intended to be used as a guideline for the testing
        activities related to the CSS Grid Layout Level 1 spec
        [[!css3-grid-layout]]. Its main goal is to provide an overview of the
        general testing areas, possible caveats and testing aspects not
        immediately apparent from the spec. Also, it provides a means of
        tracking the progress of the CSS Grid Layout spec testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document is not meant to replace the spec in determining the
        normative and non-normative assertions to be tested, but rather
        complement it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As CSS moved away from the monolithic development of CSS 2.1 to the
        modular development of CSS 3, the number of proposed new features and
        the complexity of the layout landscape have increased dramatically.
        While this directly translates to increased flexibility and agility in
        adopting and implementing new CSS features, it also increases the
        complexity of testing CSS features and the need for coordinating the
        testing efforts. Also, the need for testing coordination increases as
        crowd-sourcing efforts like
        <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/" target="_blank">Test the Web
        Forward</a> present people less familiar with the processes and
        policies of the W3C with the opportunity to contribute new tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except when defining new behaviors or redefining old behaviors, the
        implicit assumption for new CSS modules is that they play nicely with
        other modules or properties defined in CSS 2.1 [[!CSS21]]. As CSS Grid
        Layout is a spec that touches many aspects of layout, styling and
        CSSOM, it's not unreasonable to want to test the spec against these
        implicit assumptions, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        This testing strategy document is meant to complement the CSS Grid
        Layout spec and the existing test suite by providing an overview of
        the testing areas (especially the less apparent ones) and tracking
        the progress of the testing activities against these test areas.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure a comprehensive test suite with useful, high quality tests,
        a number of goals are proposed. They range from process goals (how to
        conduct testing) to implementation goals (how to write good tests).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Enabling easy test contribution</h3>
        <p>
          An important vector in successfully testing CSS Grid Layout is to
          enable easy test contributions, both from W3C partners and from
          non-W3C members that wish to contribute. This is achieved by clearly
          marking and explaining the areas that need testing, linking to
          existing tests, and general testing progress.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Providing guidance on testing</h3>
        <p>
          In order to increase the quality of the test contributions, this
          document offers a set of guidelines for conducting testing (see
          <a href="#approach" class="sectionRef"></a>) and a testing progress
          tracker to increase the surface coverage of tests (see
          <a href="#test-progress-tracking" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Creating automation-friendly tests</h3>
        <p>
          In terms of actual tests produced for the CSS Grid Layout
          specification, the main goal is to ensure that most tests are
          automatable (i.e. they're either reftests or use
          <code>testharness.js</code>). Even where manual tests are absolutely
          necessary they should be written so that they can be easily
          automated &ndash; as there are ongoing efforts to make WebDriver
          [[webdriver]] automated tests a first class citizen in W3C testing.
          This means that even if a manual test requires user interaction,
          the validation or PASS/FAIL conditions should still be clear enough
          as to allow automatic validation if said interaction is later
          automated.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
		<h2>Approach</h2>
		<p>
            As spec testing cannot be realistically separated from testing a
            particular implementation (except for the very simple cases), the
            approach proposed for testing is one that tries to first cover as
            many areas as possible, instead of deep diving on a certain
            feature or aspect of the spec first. A side benefit of this
            approach is that the spec tests can be used at any time to gauge
            the level of support of a certain implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having this <em>breadth-first</em> approach in mind, tests will be
            created for the testing areas listed in <a href="#testing-areas"
            class="sectionRef"></a>. Testing will be done in multiple passes,
            each aimed at covering more specific edge-cases.
        </p>

        <h3>Explicit testing areas</h3>
        <p>
          These are testing areas normatively defined by the spec. They cover
          things explicitly or implicitly defined in the CSS Grid Layout spec.
          Please note that while detailed, this list is not necessarily
          exhaustive and normative behaviors may not be contained in it.
          When in doubt, consult the CSS Grid Layout spec or ask a question on

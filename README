How to Organize Your Stuff
--------------------------

incoming/ is a scratchspace, put files there in whatever format
you want, you can use it as a work space or as a holding area.

submitted/ is for tests in the *correct format* only, put files
here when they are ready to be submitted for review
  http://wiki.csswg.org/test/css2.1/format
If they're not in the right format, leave them in incoming/.

approved/ is for tests that have been approved and checked in.
It mirrors the appropriate directories in the dev.w3.org
repository. Do not touch anything here unless you are a test
suite Owner or Peer, or have permission from one and know what
you are doing.

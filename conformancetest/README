This suite tests conformance to the editing spec written long ago by Aryeh
Gregor.  Nobody actually implements the spec, but the tests are still useful
for regression testing.  The tests are generated by an elaborate procedure that
no longer works, which is outlined below.  At the time of writing (August
2015), no one is meaningfully updating the specification, so there is no
impetus to get the test generation working again, and the contents of the tests
should be regarded as frozen.  Manually updating data.js is not recommended,
because it's not exactly in a maintainable format.


To generate data.js (this will only work if you're me unless you hack the
source code):

1) Visit gentest.html in both Gecko and WebKit.  Enter the secret password and
click the button to submit.

2) Once both are done submitting, run conformancetest/fixdata.  If it reports
any discrepancies, update conformancetest/diff *and* (if appropriate)
conformancetest/patch.  Do not forget to update conformancetest/patch, or else
stuff will get messed up.

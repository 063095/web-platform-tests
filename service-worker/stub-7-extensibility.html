<!--

The expectation is that Service Workers are meant to be extensible from other
specifications. As of now, [BackgroundSync][1] event, [TaskScheduler][2] and
[Push API][3] would be the prime candidates and more will come. That said, we
want to make sure that the future works won't be adding synchronous cruft, etc.
This section will provide template text for how to extend the Service Workers.

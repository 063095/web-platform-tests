<!--

Service Workers should be implemented to be HTTPS-only. The reasons for
SSL-only support include:

-   Better to protect end users from man-in-the-middle attacks
-   Do good by encouraging HTTPS adoption
-   Existing "playground" services (e.g. github.io) now work with HTTPS
-   HTTPS is coming across much more of the web quickly
-   Devtools can loosen the restriction for development (file://,
    localhost, etc.)

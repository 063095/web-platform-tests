Underscored functions and interfaces are UA-internal properties.
_ServiceWorkerRegistration represents a record of the internal map structure, [_ScopeToServiceWorkerRegistrationMap][1], keyed by a string representing a [path expression][2] of [URL scope][3], `scope`, with the value of properties, `scriptUrl`, `installingWorker` associated with an [installing worker][4], `waitingWorker` associated with a [worker in wating][5], `activeWorker` asscociated with an [active worker][6], and `updatePromise`. [_ServiceWorkerRegistration][7] object captures the Service Worker [registration][8]. _ScopeToServiceWorkerRegistrationMap represents an internal map structure that stores the entries of [_ServiceWorkerRegistration][7] object.

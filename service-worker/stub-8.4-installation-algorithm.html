Input:
    `serviceWorkerRegistration`, a [_ServiceWorkerRegistration][1] object
    `serviceWorker`, the object representing the document-side view of a
    Service Worker; a [ServiceWorker][2] object
Output:
    None
1.  Set `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`installingWorker` to `serviceWorker`.
2.  Run the [_UpdateState algorithm][3] passing
    `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`installingWorker` and `installing` as the
    arguments.
3.  [Fire an event][4] named `install` using [InstallEvent][5] interface on
    the associated [`ServiceWorkerGlobalScope`][6] object.
4.  [Fire an event][4] named `updatefound` on `navigator.serviceWorker` for
    all documents which match `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`scope`.
5.  If any handler called `waitUntil()`, then:
    1.  Extend this process until the associated promises settle.
    2.  If the resulting promise rejects, then:
        1.  Run the [_UpdateState algorithm][3] passing
            `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`installingWorker` and `redundant`
            as the arguments.
        2.  Set `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`installingWorker` to null.
        3.  Abort these steps.
6.  If `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`waitingWorker` is not null, then:
    1.  Run the [_UpdateState algorithm][3] passing
        `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`waitingWorker` and `redundant` as the
        arguments.
7.  Set `serviceWorkerRegistration.waitingWorker` to
    `serviceWorkerRegistration.installingWorker`.
8.  Set `serviceWorkerRegistration.installingWorker` to null.
9.  Run the [_UpdateState algorithm][3] passing
    `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`waitingWorker` and `installed` as the
    arguments.
10. If any handler called `replace()`, then:
    1.  For each document matching `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`scope`:
        1.  Set `serviceWorkerRegistration` as the document's Service
            Worker [registration][7].
    2.  Run [_Activation algorithm][8] passing `serviceWorkerRegistration`
        as the argument.
    3.  Abort these steps.
11. If no document is using `serviceWorkerRegistration` as their Service
    Worker [registration][7], then:
    1.  Queue a task to invoke [_Activation algorithm][8] with
        `serviceWorkerRegistration` as its argument.

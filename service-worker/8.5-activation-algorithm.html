Input:
    `serviceWorkerRegistration`, a [_ServiceWorkerRegistration][1] object
Output:
    None
1.  Let `activatingWorker` be `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`waitingWorker`.
2.  Let `exitingWorker` be `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`activeWorker`.
3.  If `exitingWorker` is not null, then:
    1.  Wait for `exitingWorker` to finish handling any in-progress
        requests.
    2.  Terminate `exitingWorker`.
    3.  Run the [_UpdateState algorithm][2] passing `exitingWorker` and
        `redundant` as the arguments.
4.  Set `serviceWorkerRegistration.activeWorker` to `activatingWorker`.
5.  Set `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`waitingWorker` to null.
6.  Run the [_UpdateState algorithm][2] passing
    `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`activeWorker` and `activating` as the
    arguments.
7.  [Fire an event][3] named `controllerchange` on
    `navigator.serviceWorker` for all documents that have used
    `serviceWorkerRegistration` as its Service Worker [registration][4].
8.  [Fire an event][3] named `activate` using [InstallPhaseEvent][5]
    interface on the associated [`ServiceWorkerGlobalScope`][6] object.
9.  If any handler calls `waitUntil()`, then:
    1.  Extend this process until the associated promises settle.
10. Run the [_UpdateState algorithm][2] passing
    `serviceWorkerRegistration`.`activeWorker` and `activated` as the
    arguments.

    <meta name="assert" content="Check if 'background-size' is '60px auto' and 'background-repeat' is 'round repeat', then the width of the background image is rescaled to approximately 60px (65.3px in this test) so that it fits a whole number of times in the width of the background positioning area, and the height is resolved by using the image's intrinsic ratio (in this test, the image's intrinsic ratio is 99:98) and (multiplied by) the size of the other dimension." />

            /* 
            background positioning area is 196px wide by 198px tall.
            So, the rounded width of the image is 65.3px, [196px / rounded (196px / 60px)]
            and the height is rescaled to 66.0px to keep the original aspect ratio.

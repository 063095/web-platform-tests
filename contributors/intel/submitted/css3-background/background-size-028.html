    <meta name="assert" content="Check if 'background-size' is '49px' and 'background-repeat' is 'repeat', then the background image is shown with a width of 49px and its height is resolved by using the image's intrinsic ratio (in this test, the image's intrinsic ratio is 99:98) and (multiplied by) the size of the other dimension, and then it is repeated in both directions." />

            Background positioning area is 196px wide by 198px tall.
            So, the image should be rescaled to 49px by 49.5px
            and be repeated four times in horizontal and vertical.

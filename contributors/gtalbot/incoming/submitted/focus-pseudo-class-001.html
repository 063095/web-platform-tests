  <p>Enter in the text zone below with the pointing device or with the keyboard (with the tab key or with the "T" accesskey) and then enter some text into it. A message in green color should then have appeared on its right-hand side indicating that such text zone has received focus state. In order to pass this test, the tester should not have to move the pointing device outside the text zone.</p>

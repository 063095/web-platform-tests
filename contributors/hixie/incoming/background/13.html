<P> According to the specs, the lovely Astrophy should line the top of
the blue box, and should spill outside the box to the left and right.
That is to say, there should be many cats in a horizontal line
touching either side of the canvas/viewport, and the cats should be
vertically aligned to be between the HTML box's blue border and the
BODY box's green border. Note that there should be one Astrophy
EXACTLY horizontally centred across the viewport, so its left paw (the
one that is to our right) should be EXACTLY above the bathroom tile
that appears at the top of the inner BODY box. </p>

<p>ASTROPHY SHOULD NOT BE CLIPPED BY THE HTML BOX'S BORDERS!</p>

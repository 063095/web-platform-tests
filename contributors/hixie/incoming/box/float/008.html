  <p> Make your window an inch or two bigger than than the width of
  one float. All floats should be the same size. This document should
  be pixel-perfect identical to <a href="009.xml">this one</a> and <a
  href="010.xml">this one</a> at all window sizes. Try resizing the
  window so that floats wrap in one or two columns. </p>

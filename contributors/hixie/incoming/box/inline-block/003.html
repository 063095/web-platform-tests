  <p> Make your window an inch or two bigger than than the width of
  one inline-block. All inline-blocks should be the same size. Try
  resizing the window so that inline-blocks wrap in one or two
  columns. </p>
  <p>There is filler text in the first line, it should merely indent the first line
  but not affect the rustulting size.</p>

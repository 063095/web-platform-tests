<!-- "In the HTML namespace, the transform property does not affect the flow of
the content surrounding the transformed element. However, the extent of the
overflow area takes into account transformed elements. This behavior is similar
to what happens when elements are offset via relative positioning. Therefore,
if the value of the 'overflow' property is 'scroll' or 'auto', scrollbars will
appear as needed to see content that is transformed outside the visible area."

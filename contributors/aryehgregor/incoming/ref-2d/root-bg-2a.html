<!-- The transform-origin here has to fall between two triangles, i.e., at a
multiple of 100px.  Otherwise after the transform, the shrunken images won't
line up with the left edge of the body, and it won't match the ref (since the
background here is positioned at the left).  We deliberately make it an odd
multiple of the number of images so it catches an IE bug; it shouldn't matter
per spec. -->

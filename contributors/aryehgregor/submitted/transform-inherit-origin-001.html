    <title>CSS Test (Transforms): "transform-origin: inherit" and em</title>

    <meta name="assert" content='The &apos;transform-origin&apos;
    property&apos;s computed value (which is what&apos;s inherited if
    &apos;inherit&apos; is specified) is defined as "For &lt;length&gt; the
    absolute value, otherwise a percentage."  In this test, a parent element
    has a transform-origin of &apos;5em 5em&apos; with a font-size of 10px, and
    the child has "transform-origin: inherit".  Since the relative length of
    5em is converted to an absolute length before inheritance, the
    transform-origin should be at the center of the child, 50px 50px.  The
    180deg rotation should thus have no effect, since the child is just a
    square.  An implementation that incorrectly inherited the transform-origin
    value before converting to an absolute length would treat it as 100px
    100px, since the child has a font-size of 20px, so it would effectively
    translate the child 100px down and to the right.'>

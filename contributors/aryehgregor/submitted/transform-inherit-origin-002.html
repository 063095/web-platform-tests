    <title>CSS Test (Transforms): "transform-origin: inherit" and percentages</title>
    <link rel="author" title="Aryeh Gregor" href="http://aryeh.name/">

    <meta name="assert" content='The &apos;transform-origin&apos;
    property&apos;s computed value (which is what&apos;s inherited if
    &apos;inherit&apos; is specified) is defined as "For &lt;length&gt; the
    absolute value, otherwise a percentage."  In this test, a parent element
    has a transform-origin of &apos;50% 50%&apos; with a height/width of 400px,
    and the child has "transform-origin: inherit" with a height/width of 100px.
    Since the transform-origin is a percentage, it&apos;s inherited before it
    gets resolved to a length.  This means it works out to 50px 50px on the
    child, at its center, so the 180deg rotation should have no visible effect.
    An implementation that incorrectly resolved the transform-origin to 200px
    200px before inheritance would display the child box translated 300px down
    and to the right.'>

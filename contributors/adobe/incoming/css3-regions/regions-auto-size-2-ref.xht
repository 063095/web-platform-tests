            <p>I am not a plane Figure, but a Solid. You call me a Circle; but in reality I
            am not a Circle, but an infinite number of Circles, of size varying from a
            Point to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter, one placed on the top of
            the other. When I cut through your plane as I am now doing, I make in your
            plane a section which you, very rightly, call a Circle. For even a Sphere -
            which is my proper name in my own country - if he manifest himself at all to
            an inhabitant of Flatland - must needs manifest himself as a Circle.</p>

            <p>Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason. The
            angles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle,) being
            much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of inanimate
            objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men and Women, it
            follows that there is no little danger lest the points of a square or
            triangular house residence might do serious injury to an inconsiderate or
            perhaps absent-minded traveller suddenly therefore, running against them:
            and as early as the eleventh century of our era, triangular houses were
            universally forbidden by Law, the only exceptions being fortifications,
            powder- magazines, barracks, and other state buildings, which it is not
            desirable that the general public should approach without circumspection.</p>

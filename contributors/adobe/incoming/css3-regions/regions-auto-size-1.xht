        <p>I am not a plane Figure, but a Solid. You call me a Circle; but in reality I
        am not a Circle, but an infinite number of Circles, of size varying from a
        Point to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter, one placed on the top of
        the other. When I cut through your plane as I am now doing, I make in your
        plane a section which you, very rightly, call a Circle. For even a Sphere -
        which is my proper name in my own country - if he manifest himself at all to
        an inhabitant of Flatland - must needs manifest himself as a Circle.</p>
        
        <p>Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason. The
        angles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle,) being
        much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of inanimate
        objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men and Women, it
        follows that there is no little danger lest the points of a square or
        triangular house residence might do serious injury to an inconsiderate or
        perhaps absent-minded traveller suddenly therefore, running against them:
        and as early as the eleventh century of our era, triangular houses were
        universally forbidden by Law, the only exceptions being fortifications,
        powder- magazines, barracks, and other state buildings, which it is not
        desirable that the general public should approach without circumspection.</p>

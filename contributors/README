W3C CSS Test Suite Repository - Contributors Section
----------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a subdirectory for submissions for each
test suite contributor. Tests inside a contributor's directory
are managed by that contributor. Approved tests are kept in
../approved/, and are managed as a common resource.

Do not touch anything outside your own directory unless you have
permission from the directory's owner or from a test suite Owner
or Peer.

Inside your contributors directory there are two subdirectories:

  incoming/ is a scratchspace, put files there in whatever format
  you want, you can use it as a work space or as a holding area.

  submitted/ is for tests in the *correct format* only, put files
  here when they are ready to be submitted for review
    http://wiki.csswg.org/test/format
  If they're not in the right format, leave them in incoming/.
  Please avoid name conflicts when adding files to your submitted/
  directory. A list of all test file names in use can be found at
    http://test.csswg.org/shepherd/

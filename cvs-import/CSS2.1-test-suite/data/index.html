 <h1>CSS2.1 Conformance Test Suite</h1>

 <p>This is a development version of the CSS2.1 Conformance Test Suite.</p>

 <p>It is woefully incomplete and contains many incorrect tests. Please
   check the latest version of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS2.1
   specification</a> before assuming a failure is due to an implementation
   bug and not a test suite bug.</p>

 <p>In time we hope to correct all errors and extend this test suite to
  cover all of CSS2.1. Your help is welcome in this effort. The appropriate
  mailing list for submitting tests and bug reports is
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>.
  More information on the contribution process and test guidelines is
  available on the <a href="http://csswg.inkedblade.net/test/css2.1">wiki
  page</a>.</p>

 <p>Tests are currently available in three formats:</p>

 <dl>
   <dt><a href="xhtml1/">XHTML 1.1</a></dt>
     <dd>XHTML 1.1 tests sent as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code></dd>
   <dt><a href="html4/">HTML 4.01</a></dt>
     <dd>HTML 4.01 tests sent as <code>text/html</code></dd>
   <dt><a href="xhtml1print/">XHTML 1.1 for Printers</a></dt>
     <dd>XHTML 1.1 tests with all images converted from PNG to JPEG
       and formatted with headers and footers to ease testing of
       embedded printer software. This is not a canonical format,
       and some tests may fail due to the format conversion that
       would otherwise pass in the above XHTML 1.1 format.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Note that many of the tests require the
   <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/resources/fonts/">Ahem font to be installed</a>.
   The tests that require this are marked with an 'a' at the end of the
   filename, after the test type classification. Without the Ahem font
   installed, these tests are of no value.</p>

  <p>In addition, some of the tests make one or more of the following
   assumptions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The device is a full-color device.</li>
    <li>The device has a viewport width of at least 640px (approx).</li>
    <li>The resolution of the device is 96 CSS pixels per inch.</li>
    <li>The 'medium' font-size computes to 16px.</li>
    <li>The initial value of 'color' is black.</li>
    <li>The canvas background is white.</li>
    <li>The user stylesheet is empty (except where indicated by the tests).</li>
    <li>The device is interactive and uses scroll bars.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The tests that need these assumptions to be true have not yet been
  marked, but it is likely that we will add a way to identify these
  tests in due course.</p>

Place tests in the appropriate directory based on the
first rel="help" link in the test. If the rel="help"
links change, move the test. Note that filenames must
be unique across the entire directory tree, not just
in that folder: the tests are split into multiple
directories only because 10000 tests in one folder is
unweildy on certain systems. The build scripts can and
do grab arbitrary subsets that occupy a single folder.

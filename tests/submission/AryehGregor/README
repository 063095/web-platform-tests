These tests are undergoing steady work and don't need to be reviewed yet.  They
were originally developed in a separate git repository, and history can be
found at <http://aryeh.name/gitweb.cgi?p=tests>.  The tests are currently based
on the WHATWG version of the HTML5 spec, so they include some features that are
part of some non-HTML5 standard at the W3C, and some features that aren't yet
in any W3C standard.
